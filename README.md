### Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lachlan Masson and I am a 4th year Software and Aerospace Engineering student ðŸ’»ðŸš€ <br/>

I am currently developing the software and hardware for a GCS and UAV system - see repo 'UAV Project.' <br/>

I have also been delving into object detection models such as YoloV5 and have been developing a suite of tools to train custom models - see repo 'YoloAnt.' <br/>

As well I have created a wrapper for the YoloV5 repository called barebones which just removes the need for some of the higher dependencies such as 'matplotlib' and refactors the way the YoloV5 repo is used so that it mimics the PyTorch wrapper - see repo 'BareBones.'<br/>

Would like to one day work with aeronautical autopilots and embedded systems! <br/>

Enjoy browsing my repos!
