### Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I have been utilising object detection models such as those in the "Yolo" family and how they can be used to "speed up" the process of training custom models - see repo 'YoloAnt (wip).' <br/>

Have been exploring methodologies to optimise virtual machine performance such as gvt-g and sr-iov.

Be sure to check out fleet-manager, yoloant_legacy and yoloant (wip).  <br/>

Enjoy browsing my repos!
